12:13 23 Aug,Russian general who ran Ukraine war fired - report,"One of Russia's leading military figures, Gen Sergei Surovikin, has reportedly lost his job as air force chief after weeks of speculation about his disappearance from public view. Ria Novosti agency said he had been relieved of his post, citing a source.  For several months Gen Surovikin was in charge of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine but he has not been seen since the Wagner mutiny in June. Observers believe his removal dates back to the botched rebellion. One Russian report quoted a defence ministry source as saying he had been dismissed because of a transfer to a new job and he was now on a short vacation. His role as head of aerospace forces has been taken on by air force chief of staff, Gen Viktor Afzalov, Ria Novosti adds. During the hours that Wagner mercenaries marched towards Moscow on 24 June, Gen Surovikin appeared in a video appealing to them to return to base.  But his awkward performance was later compared to a hostage-style video. The general was known to have good relations with Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin, who reserved his loathing for other figures in the defence hierarchy. In the weeks after the June revolt, there were unconfirmed reports by Russian military bloggers that Gen Surovikin had been detained for questioning. But officials denied he was being held in a pre-trial detention centre and one retired general said that he was merely ""resting"" and unavailable. Gen Surovikin, a 56-year-old veteran of the Soviet campaign in Afghanistan in the 1980s, was given the nickname General Armageddon for his brutal tactics in Syria.  As commander of Russian forces and later the air force he left much of the second city, Aleppo, in ruins and bombarded civilians in rebel-held Idlib province. He was the first army officer to head Russia's aerospace forces and had no experience in aviation. His big promotion came in October 2022, when he was made commander of Russian forces in Ukraine, months into the flagging, full-scale invasion. His three months in charge were not a success. On the day he was appointed, the bridge over the Kerch Strait was attacked, and weeks later he ordered a retreat from the city of Kherson. Within three months he was replaced by Russian chief of staff Valery Gerasimov, becoming one of his deputies. Russia's military leaders have had little to boast about since President Vladimir Putin sent in the troops in February 2022 and many of the top brass have been moved to different posts. Before Gen Surovikin was put in charge of the operation, the war effort was run by Col-Gen Gennady Zhidko. He died in Moscow last week after what officials said was a ""lengthy illness"".",Paul Kirby,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66590916
12:08 23 Aug,What do we know about drone attacks in Russia?,"Russia has repeatedly accused Ukraine of carrying out drone strikes on its territory in recent months. Two suspected drone attacks have struck near Moscow's main business district over the past week, hitting a skyscraper under construction on 23 August and the Expo Centre exhibition complex several days earlier. Elsewhere, three people were killed by a suspected drone attack in the border region of Belgorod on 23 August and five people were injured when a railway station was hit in Kursk Region some days earlier, Russian officials say. A suspected drone attack left one of Russia's flagship Tupolev Tu-22 bombers ablaze at an airbase south of St Petersburg, according to footage verified by the BBC. Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"". According to Russian media reports monitored by BBC Verify, there have been over 160 suspected aerial drone attacks this year in Russia and in Russian-controlled territory in Ukraine. There have also been about a dozen sea drone attacks on Russian targets in the Black Sea, including on naval bases and the Crimean bridge. The aerial drone attacks have been concentrated in the Bryansk and Belgorod regions in Russia near the western border with Ukraine, as well as in Russian-annexed Crimea. There have been a series of drone attacks in the Moscow region in recent months, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border with Ukraine, including a wave of strikes on 30 May that damaged several buildings. Flights were diverted from Vnukovo International Airport in Moscow after a drone attack on 4 July, and the airport briefly closed following drone attacks on 30 July and 1 August. Russia accused Ukraine of trying to kill President Vladimir Putin in an alleged attack on his residence in the Kremlin on 3 May - an allegation Kyiv denies. Oil facilities, airfields and energy infrastructure have all been targeted in 2023. We have identified at least nine reported drone attacks on oil depots. One of these was in Sevastopol, a major city in Crimea, which was hit on 29 April, destroying several of its oil tanks. On 31 May, an oil refinery was set ablaze in Krasnodar Territory in southern Russia, about 200km (124 miles) from the Crimean border. The regional governor said it was probably caused by a drone. Layla Guest, an analyst at Sibylline security consultancy, says: ""Ukrainian forces will highly likely prioritise targeting oil refineries, as well as railway infrastructure and wider Russian logistics, to cause maximum disruption.""  In February, a drone crashed about 100 km (62 miles) from Moscow, in what the local governor said was an attempt to target civilian infrastructure. A picture of the wreckage appeared to be consistent with a UJ-22 - a type of drone manufactured by Ukraine. It has a range of 800km (497 miles) in autonomous flight. Its range under directly-controlled flight is much shorter. Another suspected drone attack injured at least 10 Russian soldiers at a military training ground in the Voronezh region on 10 May, according to local media reports.  And in December last year, a drone attack hit an airbase 600km (372 miles) north-east of the Ukrainian border, leaving three people dead, according to the Russian military. Social media reports that several recent attacks on Moscow have involved drones of the ""Beaver"" type - a long-range attack aircraft said to be recently manufactured by Ukraine. Drone specialist Steve Wright, of the University of the West of England, cross-examined images of these aircraft against the verified footage of the 30 May strikes on Moscow. He concluded the two examples are consistent in design and the Beaver was ""most likely"" used. Drones have been deployed by both sides in the conflict, with Russia using Iranian-made drones on targets in Ukraine. Ukraine says it is rapidly increasing its production of drones as demand grows on the front line. In terms of range, experts say drones launched from Ukraine could reach deep into Russian territory, and as far as Moscow, which is about 450km (280 miles) from the border. ""Although Ukraine has not confirmed that its armed forces carried out the attacks [on Moscow], I think that the pre-emptive raids we have seen last year prove that Ukraine has the capability to launch long range attacks of that kind from within Ukrainian territory,"" says David Cenciotti, editor of the Aviationist blog.  Drone specialist Steve Wright also said it was possible that a drone could hit the Kremlin having been launched from within Ukraine.  But he added: ""My guess is that the drone was launched from far closer in than that, as this would avoid it having to run the gauntlet of much of Moscow's defences."" Ukraine's Minister for Digital Transformation Mykhailo Fedorov boasted of a Ukrainian drone called the R18 that ""can fly from Kyiv to Moscow and back"". But he denied that he was calling for drone strikes on Moscow. Mr Cenciotti says: ""Ukraine has made extensive use of several drones, with the Bayraktar TB2 drone emerging as the real star of the air war for Ukraine, inflicting heavy losses on Russian forces, some of those caught on tape and circulated online."" Turkey has sold Bayraktar TB2 armed drones to Ukraine in recent months, while the Turkish manufacturer of the drones has donated to crowd-funding operations in support of Ukraine.

12:02 23 Aug,Three killed in Russian shelling in eastern Ukraine,"Three people have been killed in Russian artillery fire near the eastern Ukrainian city of Lyman, Ukrainian authorities say. The three who reportedly died - two women and a man aged 63 to 88 - were sitting on a bench in the village of Torske when shelling hit. The area is close to the front line and regularly comes under attack. Meanwhile a drone attack on the Danube river port of Izmail destroyed 13,000 tons of grain. Deputy Prime Minister Oleksandr Kubrakov said the grain had been destined for export to Egypt and Romania and the drone strike had reduced the port's export capacity by 15%. ""Russia is systematically hitting grain silos and warehouses to stop agricultural exports,"" he said. Over the past month Russian strikes on its sea and river ports had destroyed 270,000 tons of grain, he said. Elsewhere, there have been reports of explosions in the port city of Sevastopol in Russian-occupied Crimea. The peninsula's Russian-appointed proxy governor said the fleet was conducting firing exercises. Meanwhile, four civilians were injured by mortar fire and a residential building was damaged by two drones in Seredyna-Buda, in the Sumy region of north-eastern Ukraine, the regional military administration said on Facebook.",Emily McGarvey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66589595

9:33 23 Aug,Charity transports donated fridges to Ukraine,"Three trucks are transporting fridges and other essential supplies to Ukraine to help people affected by the war. The Wiltshire based charity, UK to Ukraine, has collected about 17 fridges and freezers from local people.  Residents living near the Kakhovka Dam, which was breached in June, will be given the supplies. Henrietta Nettlefold, from the charity, said: ""When the dam was blown up, people's houses were completely ruined and they are living hand to mouth."" As well as fridges, the charity is sending a rescue vehicle, clothes and medical supplies. The trucks set off from Chichester on Tuesday afternoon. Ms Nettlefold said the response had been ""fantastic"" and those who have donated have been ""absolutely extraordinary"". The charity works in partnership with Stay Safe, an organisation based on the eastern border of Ukraine.  Stay Safe is working to rehouse and resettle people in the area whilst also providing up to 150 hot meals a day.  Ms Nettflefold said: ""There are many people there who are living in absolute desperate situations while they try and get rehoused. ""We cannot thank Wiltshire and the surrounding counties enough. ""We will continue to provide aid in delivering what we can to the front line.  ""We will do whatever they tell us they need."" Follow BBC West on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

23:58 22 Aug,UK to support Ukraine with nuclear power backing,"UK support will help power Ukraine's nuclear plants, Energy Security Secretary Grant Shapps has said after visiting the country.  The government has announced it will provide a Â£192m loan guarantee to enable a UK-based company to supply Ukraine with uranium enrichment services, a vital part of nuclear fuel. Nuclear power generates more than half of Ukraine's electricity.  But its largest plant, at Zaporizhzhia, is currently held by Russia.  While he was in Ukraine on Tuesday, Mr Shapps visited a power station, which has been badly damaged by Russian bombing.  He also met senior Ukrainian ministers and energy industry figures in Kyivâ¯to discuss the UK's support for the country's recovery.â¯  The government has said it will provide the loan guarantee through UK Export Finance - the UK's export credit agency - to enable UK-headquartered company Urenco to supply Ukraine's national nuclear company, â¯Energoatom.  The Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said this would bring the total of the UK's non-military assistance to Ukraine to nearly Â£5bn. It said the support would strengthen Ukraine's energy security as it defends itself against the Russian invasion, as well as maintain its independence from Russian nuclear fuel. Ukraine has four nuclear power plants - including Europe's largest at Zaporizhzhia - but before the Russian invasion in February 2022 it had been receiving most of its nuclear services and fuel from Russia.  It has been reducing its dependence and in June last year signed a deal with US company Westinghouse to supply fuel to all its nuclear power stations.  Mr Shapps said: ""Our support for Ukraine is unwavering in the face of [Russian President Vladimir] Putin's barbaric invasion - the UK continues to stand with Ukraine as they repel Russian attacks and rebuild their country."" He added: ""Putin has used energy as a weapon of war: the action today to support nuclear fuel deliveries will help Ukraine end their reliance on Russian supplies and bolster their energy security.""  The UK announcement comes after a meeting of G7 energy ministers in Japan earlier this year, where the UK, US, Canada, Japan and France agreed a new nuclear fuel alliance in an attempt to strengthen the sector in each country and push Russia out of the market.  Other European countries have also offered financial support to Ukraine's energy sector through the Ukraine Energy Support Fund, which aims to repair damage caused by Russia to infrastructure and keep it running.  Last year, Mr Shapps took in a Ukrainian family as part of the government's Homes for Ukraine scheme.  While in Ukraine, Mr Shapps visited a kindergarten, which was damaged by Russian shelling and was previously attended by Nikita, the young son of the family who lived with him.  The children performed a song before Mr Shapps played them a recorded message from Nikita.â¯",Becky Morton,https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-66586785
12:32 22 Aug,Ukrainian drone destroys Russian supersonic bomber,"A flagship Russian long-range bomber has been destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike, according to reports. Images posted on social media and analysed by BBC Verify show a Tupolev Tu-22M on fire at Soltsy-2 airbase, south of St Petersburg. Moscow said that a drone was hit by small-arms fire but managed to ""damage"" a plane. Ukraine has not commented. The Tu-22M can travel at twice the speed of sound and has been used extensively to attack Ukraine. The Russian defence ministry said in a statement that an attack by a ""copter-type UAV"" took place at around 10:00 Moscow time (07:00 GMT) on Saturday.  It stated the location as ""a military airfield in the Novgorod region"", where Soltsy-2 is situated. ""The UAV was detected by the airfield's observation outpost and was hit with small-arms fire,"" the ministry said. ""One airplane was damaged; there were no casualties as a result of the terrorist act."" The statement also said a fire which broke out in the airfield parking lot was quickly extinguished.  However, images posted on the social media platform Telegram showed a large fire engulfing a jet with the distinctive nose cone of the Tu-22M.  BBC Verify analysed the images and believes them to be credible. The UK Ministry of Defence said in an intelligence briefing that it was ""highly likely destroyed"" in the attack on Soltsy-2. While the destruction of a single aircraft will have little effect on the potency of Moscow's current 60-strong fleet, the operation highlights Kyiv's growing ability to strike targets deep inside Russian territory.  Kyiv has over recent months launched dozens of fixed-wing unmanned aircraft to attack Moscow, several hundred miles away. Soltsy-2 is around 400 miles (650km) from the Ukraine border. However, the Russian MoD's description of the drone as a ""copter-type UAV"" suggests a cheap, commercially available device launched at short range. The Tu-22M is a Cold War-era, swing-wing supersonic bomber, codenamed ""Backfire"" by Nato, which has been used extensively in attacks on Ukrainian cities.  Modern versions such as the Tu-22M3 can reach speeds of Mach 2 (2,300km/h or 1,430mp/h) and can carry up to 24,000kg of weapons, including ""dumb bombs"" and homing missiles. They have been used in conflicts in Syria, Chechnya, and Georgia and most recently in Ukraine.  According to prosecutors in Kyiv, 30 people were killed when a Tu-22M-launched missile hit a block of flats in Dnipro in January.  They said Russia's 52nd Guards Bomber Aviation Regiment carried out the attack. The regiment is based at Soltsy-2. BBC Verify confirmed the location of the Ukrainian drone attack on Soltsy-2 by comparing visual clues - such as the appearance of aircraft and bays - to historical satellite images of the airbase.  The weather conditions at the time - wet and overcast - also matched the weather in the images, as well as other witness photos of the incident. The remnants of the aircraft visible in the footage are consistent with that of a Tu-22M3.  Historical satellite imagery analysed by BBC Verify shows that aircraft of this kind were stationed at the base. On Monday, a spokesperson for Ukraine's defence intelligence service said another military aircraft had been damaged in a drone attack in Russia's Kaluga region.  Russian media also reported the attack, but denied there had been any damage.",Graeme Baker,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66573842
6:54 22 Aug,Ukrainian drones downed over Moscow region - Russia,"Russia's defence ministry says it has thwarted a Ukrainian drone attack after it downed two drones over the Moscow region. Two other drones were intercepted over the Bryansk region, north-east of the Ukrainian border, it added. Flights were temporarily stopped to and from Moscow's airports early on Tuesday, the ministry said. Airspace above Moscow has been closed several times in recent days as reports of drone strikes become more regular. The defence ministry also said a Russian warplane had destroyed a Ukrainian reconnaissance boat in the Black Sea that had sailed near Russian gas production facilities. Early on Tuesday, Moscow's Mayor Sergei Sobyanin said Russian air defences had shot down two drones to the west of the capital in the Krasnogorsk and Chastsy districts. No injuries were reported in the attacks and Ukraine has not commented. Although Ukraine has not claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"". On Saturday, a flagship Russian long-range bomber was destroyed in a Ukrainian drone strike, according to reports.

4:01 22 Aug,The men who don't want to fight for Ukraine,"Ukraine is struggling to meet its demand for soldiers.  Volunteers aren't enough. The country constantly needs to replace the tens of thousands who've been killed or injured. Many more are just exhausted, after 18 months fighting off Russia's full-scale invasion.  Some men though don't want to fight. Thousands have left the country, sometimes after bribing officials, and others are finding ways of dodging recruitment officers, who in turn have been accused of increasingly heavy-handed tactics.  ""The system is very outdated,"" says Yehor. He watched his father suffer from mental health issues after fighting with the Soviet Army in Afghanistan.   It's why he doesn't want to fight. He's asked that we don't use his real name to protect his identity.   Typically, before Russia's invasion, men who didn't want to do military service because of their religious beliefs would be offered an alternative - like working in farming or social services. That choice disappeared with the start of martial law last year, but Yehor thinks it should still be available, regardless of peoples' reasons. ""Each situation is individual,"" argues Yehor. ""The fact it is written in the constitution that all male citizens must fight is, in my opinion, not in line with today's values."" He was recently sent to a recruitment centre after being stopped by police in Kyiv, who accused him of avoiding the draft. He was eventually allowed to go home, after pleading that he had back problems, but next time he fears he won't be.  There are exemptions from service, including having poor health, being a single parent, and caring for someone vulnerable. But those convicted of draft-dodging face fines, or even up to three years in prison.  ""Everyone should be allowed to contribute to this war if their situations are taken into account,"" says Yehor. ""I feel sorry for people who are on the front lines, yet I don't have a pacifist alternative.""  The way Kyiv conscripts men has been accused of being corrupt at its core.  President Volodymyr Zelensky has sacked every regional head of recruitment in Ukraine after widespread allegations against officers in the system, including bribe-taking and intimidation.  The family of one military draft chief in Odesa were even accused recently of buying cars and property on Spain's southern coast costing millions of dollars. The officer reportedly denies any knowledge of this.  Defence officials have told the BBC the alleged offences are ""shameful and unacceptable"".  Mobilisation is why most men under 60 can't leave Ukraine. Thousands often try to sneak out of the country, mostly across the Carpathian mountains to Romania.  For those who stay, mass group chats help them avoid being drafted. Telegram threads give tip-offs on where drafting officers are patrolling. There are chats for different regions and cities across the country, sometimes with more than 100,000 members each.  The officers in these groups are known as Olives, because of the colour of their uniforms. People they encounter are typically handed notices ordering them to register at a recruitment centre, but there are reports of some being taken away on the spot, without a chance to return home.  Ukraine's Defence Ministry urges people to keep their details updated on a national database, and says that if they are called up they'll be sent to a suitable posting.  But there are claims of officers using harsh or intimidating tactics. There are also reports of conscripts finding themselves on the front line with just a month of training.  The authorities do seem keen to restore confidence.  ""It's OK to be afraid,"" is the slogan of their latest information campaign. It's an attempt to draw parallels between childhood fears and the worries of today.  In an abandoned summer camp in Kyiv, civilians are trained in resisting Russian soldiers, in case of need. They patrol the paths before an instructor shouts, ""Second group! Grenade!"" The men and women quickly fling themselves on the ground.  Their rifles are not real, but there's a hope some participants will sign up for the real thing. Anton, a 22-year-old student, has already made up his mind.  ""When the war started, I wasn't ready to get drafted,"" he tells me during a break from rolling in the grass.  ""Now I have to get prepared to go to war in the future.""  Anton doesn't think it's good that people avoid the draft, but he understands why someone wouldn't want to fight.  I ask him if he's scared of the prospect.  ""Of course,"" he replies, almost cutting me off. ""Everyone is scared. But if the situation gets any worse, there's no way I'll be sitting here in Kyiv.""  Ukraine has defied all expectations in its defence against Russia's full-scale invasion.  Moscow's focus has been forced to shift from taking the whole country to trying to hang on to a fifth of it.  But Ukraine is having to do its own recalibrations.  Not just with its own counteroffensive, which is bringing progress slower than many hoped, but also with how it motivates its citizens to fight.  There is an undeniable need, but also an uncomfortable truth, in the battlefield not being for everyone.

23:06 21 Aug,"Wagner making Africa more free, says Prigozhin","Wagner chief Yevgeny Prigozhin has appeared in his first video address since his failed mutiny in Russia, which suggests he is in Africa. The BBC has not been able to verify where the video was filmed. The video posted on Telegram channels linked to the Wagner mercenary group shows him in combat gear, saying the group is making Africa ""more free"". Wagner is believed to have thousands of fighters on the continent, where it has lucrative business interests. Mr Prigozhin's soldiers are embedded in countries including Mali and the Central African Republic (CAR) - where rights groups and the UN accuse them of committing war crimes. The UK last month imposed sanctions on the two heads of Wagner's operations in CAR, accusing them of torture and killing civilians. Wagner fighters have also been accused by the US of enriching themselves with illicit gold deals on the continent. In the video, Mr Prigozhin says Wagner is exploring for minerals as well as fighting Islamist militants and other criminals. ""We are working. The temperature is +50 - everything as we like. Wagner PMC conducts reconnaissance and search actions, makes Russia even greater on all continents, and Africa even more free,"" Mr Prigozhin can be heard saying. ""Justice and happiness - for the African people, we're making life a nightmare for ISIS (Islamic State) and Al-Qaeda and other bandits."" He says Wagner is recruiting and the group will ""continue fulfilling the tasks that were set - we made promises we would succeed"". Mr Prigozhin was photographed in St Petersburg during last month's Africa-Russia summit, shaking hands with Ambassador Freddy Mapouka, a presidential advisor in the CAR. Mr Prigozhin has been keeping a low public profile since heading his short-lived mutiny in June, which lasted only 24 hours. About 5,000 Wagner troops seized control of the southern Russian city of Rostov-on-Don and moved towards Moscow, with the stated aim of removing the military leadership. However, Mr Prigozhin stopped the advance after negotiations with the Kremlin, which were mediated by Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko. Under a deal to end the mutiny, charges against Mr Prigozhin were dropped and he was offered a move to Belarus. There had been very public infighting between Wagner and Russia's ministry of defence over the conduct of the war. Mr Prigozhin repeatedly accused the ministry of failing to supply his group with ammunition. Mr Prigozhin says he founded the Wagner group in 2014. A wealthy businessman with a criminal record, Mr Prigozhin is known as ""Putin's chef"" because he provided catering for the Kremlin. In 2014, Wagner started backing pro-Russian separatist forces in eastern Ukraine, and is thought to have helped Russia annex Crimea. Before the war in Ukraine, Wagner had an estimated 5,000 fighters - mostly veterans of Russia's elite regiments and special forces. However, Mr Prigozhin said last June that its numbers had grown since the start of the Ukraine war to 25,000 fighters.",Emily McGarvey,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66576990
16:07 21 Aug,Domino's Pizza signals closure of Russian business,"The franchise owner of Domino's in Russia has signalled it will close its branches there as it announced it will place the business into bankruptcy. DP Eurasia said it would end attempts to sell the pizza chain's shops in the country due to an ""increasingly challenging environment"". Many Western firms have cut ties with Russia since the invasion of Ukraine and introduction of economic sanctions. But some, including Domino's, have faced criticism for not exiting. DP Eurasia has 171 Domino's Pizza shops in Russia. It owns 68 of the sites, while 103 are franchised to local operators. On Monday, DP Eurasia said in a London Stock Exchange announcement that it had decided its subsidiary in Russia, DP Russia, should file for bankruptcy, rather than seek a buyer. ""With the increasingly challenging environment, DP Russia's immediate holding company is now compelled to take this step, which will bring about the termination of the attempted sale process of DP Russia as a going concern and, inevitably, the group's presence in Russia,"" it said. The firm previously said it was ""evaluating its presence"" in Russia following sanctions being imposed. As well as owning Domino's franchises in Russia, DP Eurasia has master franchise rights for the brand in Turkey, Russia, Azerbaijan and Georgia. The Russian economy has been targeted by a raft of sanctions since the outbreak of war in Ukraine in February 2022.  Many companies that are household names decided to close their operations in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. Pressure was also mounted on big brands such as McDonald's and Coca-Cola to act.  There has also been ongoing criticism for the ones which have continued business. Unilever is one company that has defended its decision to keep operating in Russia, with the maker of Dove soap and Cornetto ice cream arguing that it is ""not straightforward"" as its operations would be taken over by the Russian state if it abandoned them. The Moral Rating Agency, which campaigns for Western firms to leave Russia, has claimed the Unilever was contributing Â£579m to the Russian economy annually. Domino's Pizza Inc, the American multi-national business and master franchisor, told the BBC that through its subsidiary companies, it stopped providing ""any support for the Russian market in early 2022"".",Michael Race,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-66574219
12:28 21 Aug,Gas prices rise on fears of strikes in Australia,"The prospect of a possible strike at a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant in Australia has pushed wholesale gas prices up in Europe. The Offshore Alliance union warned that a strike at the North West Shelf facility could start as early as 2 September if no deal on pay is reached. Benchmark gas prices for the EU and UK rose around 10% on Monday, according to Bloomberg. Prices soared after Russia's invasion of Ukraine but have since fallen. There are fears that strike action at Woodside Energy Group's North West Shelf facility could cause disruption to shipments of LNG from Australia, which is a key global supplier. Workers at two other offshore LNG facilities, Gorgon and Wheatstone, operated by Chevron, are also voting on strike action, with results expected on Thursday. Together the three plants make up about 10% of the world's supply of LNG. Ben McWilliams, an affiliate fellow at the think tank Bruegel, warned the strikes might impact the prices globally of LNG. Speaking to the BBC's Newsday programme earlier this month, Mr McWilliams said: ""Australia typically supplies Asia, but if these strikes were to go ahead, and Australian gas were cut to Asian consumers, we would see Asian consumers turning around and looking, for example, to Qatar and competing with European buyers there."" Mr McWilliams said that if that were to happen there would be a ""knock-on effect on prices"". Following the start of the war in Ukraine, Russia slashed supplies of natural gas to Europe, which led countries to seek out alternative sources of energy. Many countries are relying on LNG to fill the gap. Australia is one of the world's largest exporters of LNG. The others are Qatar and the US. Last week, Cornwall Insight predicted that higher gas prices resulting from the Australian uncertainty would contribute to a significant rise in the Ofgem price cap in January.  It forecast a cap of Â£2,082.56 for a typical annual household bill for the first quarter of 2024, a rise from its Â£1,925.71 forecast for the fourth quarter of 2023.

14:53 20 Aug,Aid worker 'humbled' by Ukraine soldiers' messages,"An air worker who moved to Ukraine has told of how front-line soldiers sent him video messages of thanks for the parcels they received. Steve Hodgson, from Tebay, Cumbria, left the UK to join his fiancÃ©e Natasha and work for a charity in Ukraine. He sent parcels to soldiers fighting in Bakhmut and said he received ""the most unbelievably amazing response."" ""These guys are doing the fighting and dying, and I'm just a delivery driver who goes nowhere near,"" he said. Mr Hodgson has spent the last year delivering aid from the UK, including medical supplies for hospitals and nurseries. He has since sold-up, quit his job as a tree surgeon and joined his fiancÃ©e in Odessa, in the south of the country. Mr Hodgson, who has now travelled to Uzhhorod in Western Ukraine, has also recorded an audio diary for BBC Radio Cumbria. The 52-year-old described the messages from the soldiers as ""very emotional and humbling to watch"".   ""[It was] short, nothing fancy, just a simple video from these guys, being bombed by Russia, as they speak to me, saying thank you for the boots, thank you for the clothes, thank you for the medicines.  ""It's incredibly emotional and incredibly hard to sometimes process. ""I will keep helping where I can and do everything I can - these guys are doing the fighting and dying. That makes every single little problem I encounter irrelevant."" Follow BBC North East & Cumbria on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

12:16 20 Aug,Ukraine drone injures 5 at train station - Russia,"Russia says that a Ukrainian drone has struck a railway station in the Kursk region, injuring five people. Another drone is said to have landed in the Rostov region - which shares a border with Ukraine, like Kursk - but no injuries were reported. Russia also said it stopped a drone that was heading for Moscow, which then crashed in an unpopulated area.  Allegations of drone strikes inside Russia have become increasingly common in recent months.  Although Ukraine hasn't claimed responsibility for specific drone strikes, President Volodymyr Zelensky has previously said that attacks on Russian territory are an ""inevitable, natural and absolutely fair process"". Footage verified by the BBC shows smashed windows and a fire burning at the railway station in Kursk, which is about 150 km (93 miles) from the Ukrainian border. Five people were injured by glass fragments, Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported. The roof, exterior, and platform of the station were damaged.  The Russian foreign ministry said it ""strongly condemns"" the drone attack in Kursk.  ""Ukrainian nationalists literally dealt a blow to our common history,"" ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said in a statement. In its own statement, Russia's defence ministry said it had ""thwarted"" an ""attempt by the Kyiv regime to carry out a terrorist attack by drone on infrastructure in Moscow"" around 04:00 local time (01:00 GMT). The Moscow-bound drone was destroyed by ""electronic warfare"" before losing control and crashing in an unpopulated area, the ministry added. Russia's aviation agency Rosaviatsia said flights to the Domodedovo and Vnukovo international airports were ""temporarily limited"" as a result.  It comes after seven people, including a six-year-old girl, were killed when a Russian missile struck a theatre in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Saturday. Fifteen children were among 148 people wounded, officials said.  President Zelensky vowed to ""respond to Russia for this terrorist attack - a tangible answer"".

7:00 20 Aug,Paintings of refugees 'show hosts' generosity',"A Ukrainian artist who paints family portraits for refugees to give to UK hosts is ""immortalising"" Britons' generosity, she says.  Olha Son, who went to Cornwall when she arrived in the UK, was asked for paintings to thank people's hosts.  The 35-year-old's art shows Britons sheltering Ukrainian refugees with a Union flag-decorated umbrella.  She also said she felt she was ""doing something important"", partly showing the impact of the war in Ukraine. Ms Son said she started painting five years ago when she was diagnosed with depression and initially painted still-life images, before receiving a message from a fellow Ukrainian refugee asking for a gift for their host family.  She brainstormed ideas for the painting, which was ""easy"" because she ""was in an identical situation as my customer and I knew what it feels like to feel what they feel"".  Since then, she has had commissions from other refugees who wanted to thank their hosts. She said: ""It's like immortalising this phenomena of a British family who made a decision to open their doors to strangers from a different country, a different culture, in order to help in such a devastating situation as the war."" One couple who received a painting from the Ukrainian family living with them for some months was Kevin Kennedy Ryan, 33, and Jessica Ryan Smith 32, from Sheffield.  The couple gave them a painting showing their two families, painted by Ms Son, which Mr Kennedy Ryan said left them ""speechless"" and ""drove home some of the reality of the situation"".  The British couple offered their home to refugees before Russia invaded Ukraine and said: ""It's not necessarily about refugees from Ukraine or any one particular area.  ""We all have this humanity that we share together."" Follow BBC News South West on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.

23:37 19 Aug,"Seven dead, 144 injured in strike on Ukraine theatre","Seven people, including a six-year-old girl, were killed when a Russian missile struck a theatre in the northern Ukrainian city of Chernihiv on Saturday morning, officials have said. Fifteen children were among 144 people wounded, the police said. At least 25 people were in hospital. Among the victims were people who had been celebrating an Orthodox Christian holiday at church. A main square and a university building were also damaged in the attack. The UN called it ""heinous"", while Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky vowed a firm response by Ukrainian soldiers to a ""terrorist attack"".  Chernihiv is located about 50km (31 miles) south of Ukraine's border with Belarus. It was besieged by Russian troops in the first few months of President Vladimir Putin's full-scale invasion launched in February 2022. The city's imposing theatre was hit directly. Tiles were blown off the roofs of neighbouring buildings with one catching fire 100 metres away. The theatre was hosting a gathering of drone manufacturers, the acting mayor of Chernihiv told the BBC. ""I understand that their aim was a military event taking place in the building of the drama theatre and that it was their target,"" Oleksandr Lomako said.  ""But it is clear that the Russians launching those missiles and those giving them orders in the middle of the day to the civilian city realised that the victims will be primarily civilians. ""There is no other way to interpret it than a war crime against civilians, yet another Russian war crime,"" he added. Ukrainian Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko later said all those inside the theatre had managed to reach shelter in time.  He said that ""most of the victims were in their vehicles or crossing the road at the time of the rocket strike, as well as returning from a church"". The city centre of Chernihiv is a popular area for people to stroll around, especially on the weekend, locals told the BBC. Anna Zahreba, the manager of a Crimean Tatar restaurant just across the street from the theatre, said her staff were getting ready for a busy day when the missile hit.  ""I ran outside to see what was going on,"" she said. ""There were two 12-year-old girls here and a lot of blood. One had her leg badly wounded. Another girl was screaming. ""We applied a tourniquet and waited for an ambulance. It was taking a long time to get here, but some man stopped his car and we took a girl to a hospital.""  Anna says staff rushed to help injured people with medical kit and blankets.  ""There are always many people walking around here, with children and baby strollers. Many restaurants and cafes in the area,"" she tells us.  ""We did not expect a day like this.""  In his video address late on Saturday, President Zelensky said the child killed in the Russian strike was a girl named Sofia.  Earlier, he said that Russia had turned an ""ordinary Saturday"" into ""a day of pain and loss"". The UN said it was ""extremely disturbed"" by the attack. ""It is heinous to attack the main square of a large city, in the morning, while people are out walking, some going to the church to celebrate a religious day for many Ukrainians,"" Denise Brown, the current head of the UN in Ukraine, said in a statement. ""Attacks directed against civilians or civilian objects are strictly prohibited under international humanitarian law,"" she said. ""It must stop."" Three days of mourning have been announced in the city.  Moscow is yet to comment. Elsewhere, Russia has claimed that a Ukrainian drone hit a military airfield in the northwest Novgorod region, causing a fire that was quickly put out. One plane was damaged but no casualties have been reported, it added.  Ukraine has not commented on the alleged drone attack.  Meanwhile, Kyiv's air force said the Ukrainian military had shot down 15 out of 17 Iranian-made Shahed drones launched by Moscow in an overnight strike.",Ukraine correspondent James Waterhouse & George Wright,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66554412
23:00 18 Aug,Cat and dog influencers help Ukrainians cope with war," From fundraising to detecting explosives, cats and dogs have been helping Ukrainians deal with the devastating impact of Russia's invasion. Patron, the mine-sniffing dog, is one of them. He works for Ukraine's state emergency service - but his mine-clearance skills and apparently disarming charisma have also earned him hundreds of thousands of followers online.  He and a number of other animals - some real, some cartoon - have been offering emotional support and posting practical advice on their social media accounts.  This ranges from guidance on how to deal with difficult feelings caused by war to tips on what to do when you see an explosive device. Through his work, Patron has met numerous dignitaries and celebrities visiting Kyiv, including Lord of the Rings star Orlando Bloom, UK Prime Minister Rishi Sunak and Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Ukraine's postal service has printed stamps featuring the canine hero, who has also been awarded a medal for ""dedicated service"" by President Volodymyr Zelensky. Patron's owner and handler, Mykhaylo Ilyev, says his meetings with foreign dignitaries have helped Ukraine's emergencies services secure donations of crucial mine-clearing equipment.  The Jack Russell terrier has been involved in raising funds for people affected by war, particularly his colleagues injured while clearing mines. He has taken part in charity collections for animals too.  ""Our little friends are going through a rough time after being abandoned or injured. We realise that they also want to live and that they need help,"" Mr Ilyev tells the BBC. Patron's account on Instagram offers not just pictures of the charismatic dog, but also hope, inspiration and advice for Ukrainians facing the horrors of war. ""Hope matters. We hope that this will be over soon. We hope that victory is near. We hope that people won't be killed anymore. Sometimes hope is all we've got,"" reads one of his posts.  ""Don't lose hope, I'm begging you. Now, let me give you a hopeful lick!"" Patron also features in a cartoon series educating children about the dangers posed by unexploded munitions. Despite his celebrity status, Patron is still doing his mine-sniffing day job, Mr Ilyev says. Stepan the cat hails from Saltivka, a district in Ukraine's second-largest city of Kharkiv that has been badly damaged by Russian shelling. Before the war, Stepan was just another incredibly cute cat from the internet. But since Russia's full-scale invasion, his Instagram account started offering more than just pictures - it started to comment on the war.  It has now switched to Ukrainian, too, even though it previously used Russian, which was widely spoken in parts of the east and south. Many people across Ukraine did the same after Russia invaded. ""We've all changed mentally after seeing what sort of thing this 'Russian world' really is,"" Stepan's owner Anna tells the BBC, referring to a concept promoted by Russia to justify intervention abroad ostensibly in support of Russian speakers. ""Ukrainian is part of my life and the life of my country and nation,"" she says. Stepan's account, which has 1.3m followers on Instagram, has used its popularity to help animals who have suffered in the war. Last year, he helped raise almost 15,000 euros (Â£12,900) which was spent on food, medicine and other care for them.  After the destruction of the Kakhovka Dam in southern Ukraine in June, the cat helped collect funds for the evacuation of animals from flooded areas.  His account was also involved in a collection to repair a library damaged by shelling in Kharkiv. But it is not just about the money for Stepan's account. ""He has been offering support to people, particularly children, so that they can forget the horrors of this war at least for a little while. That's why there is a bit of humour in his posts,"" Anna says. Stepan also tackles the realities of war in his posts, including this one: ""Oh how I want my country to win as soon as possible! So that there is peace for which people on the front line have sacrificed their lives. So that there are no more missiles, so that people and animals stop dying."" People are more receptive to advice if it looks as though it is coming from a fluffy pet, says Olena Pavlova, who created a cartoon character called Inzhyr the cat. ""A cat picture travels much further than just words. I've seen it many times,"" she tells me. ""Pictures and memes featuring cats can help deliver a lot of important ideas. They're easier to absorb. Cat pictures help us cope."" ""Inzhyr the cat is a natural anti-depressant. I created him to make myself and also my readers feel better. He's positive, cuddly and nice, and he's helping people find hope and light inside themselves,"" Ms Pavlova says. Inzhyr's accounts on social media encourage Ukrainians to read more books and offer advice on issues such as fundraising, burnout and why everyone should be like a cat. ""Cats waste no effort, but are determined in achieving their goals,"" one of his posts reads. Sound words of advice for anyone, whether at war or not.",Vitaly Shevchenko,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66509999
22:56 18 Aug,US allows allies to give Ukraine F-16 war planes,"The US has approved the transfer to Ukraine of American-made F-16 fighter jets from Denmark and the Netherlands when Ukrainian pilots are fully trained to operate them.  ""This way, Ukraine can take full advantage of its new capabilities,"" a US state department spokesman said. Ukraine praised the decision it had been pushing hard for since last year. But it is expected to be months before Kyiv will be able to use F-16s to try to counter Russia's air superiority. The Dutch are thought to have about 24 operational F-16s which are scheduled to be taken out of service and replaced by more advanced war planes. Denmark is also planning an upgrade of its fleet of some 30 F-16s. The US and its allies had earlier ruled out providing F-16s to Ukraine, fearing that this would lead to further escalation with a nuclear-armed Russia. Russia - which launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - has so far made no public comment on the issue. Both Denmark and the Netherlands had been given ""formal assurances"" for the transfer of their multi-role F-16 war planes, the US state department spokesman said. The spokesman added that this would happen ""as soon as the first set of pilots complete their training"". Dutch Foreign Minister Wopke Hoekstra welcomed the US decision, saying that ""this marks a major milestone for Ukraine to defend its people and its country"". ""Now we will further discuss the subject with our European partners,"" he wrote in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter. Danish Defence Minister Jakob Ellemann-Jensen echoed his words.  ""The government has said several times that a donation is a natural next step after training. We are discussing it with close allies,"" he told Denmark's Ritzau news agency. In Ukraine, Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov described the US decision as ""great news"".  ""Our military has proven it is filled with fast learners. We will soon prove that Ukraine's victory is inevitable. Thank you to all our partners and friends in the United States, the Netherlands and Denmark. Onward to Victory!"" he wrote on X. An 11-member coalition of Ukraine's allies in the West is due to start training Ukrainian pilots later this month and they are expected to be ready next year. Earlier this week, Ukraine's Air Force spokesman Yuriy Ihnat admitted that Kyiv would not be able to operate F-16s this coming autumn and winter. The F-16 Fighting Falcon is widely considered one of the world's most reliable fighter jets. It can be armed with precision-guided missiles and bombs and is able to fly at 1,500mph (2,400km/h), according to the US Air Force. The F-16's targeting capabilities would allow Ukraine to attack Russian forces in all weather conditions and at night with greater accuracy. Ukraine is believed to have dozens of combat aircraft - mostly MiGs - all dating from the Soviet era, and the country is currently badly outgunned by Russia in the air. Kyiv needs modern war planes to help protect its skies from regular deadly Russian missile and drone attacks, and also to support its counter-offensive in southern and eastern Ukraine that has so far yielded limited results.",Jaroslav Lukiv,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66551478
19:25 18 Aug,Russia sanctions UK politicians and journalists,"Russia has banned 54 British nationals and people working for UK organisations from entering the country in retaliation for UK sanctions on its citizens, its foreign ministry says. They include Culture Secretary Lucy Frazer and International Criminal Court chief prosecutor Karim Khan. A number of journalists from the BBC, the Daily Telegraph and the Guardian are also on the list. The BBC said it would ""continue to report independently and fairly"". The Russian foreign ministry said the move was in response to ""the aggressive implementation by London of a hostile anti-Russian course"". Ms Frazer was sanctioned for ""actively lobbying for the international sports isolation of Russia"", while Minister of State for Defence Annabel Goldie was described as being ""responsible for the supply of weapons to Ukraine"". In March the International Criminal Court issued an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin, accusing him of the war crime of illegally deporting children from Ukraine, which Moscow denies. Mr Khan told the BBC at the time: ""Children can't be treated as the spoils of war, they can't be deported."" The BBC journalists include chief executive Deborah Turness, presenter and analysis editor Ros Atkins and disinformation and social media correspondent Marianna Spring. The Russian foreign ministry said it would continue to expand its ""stop list"". Russia has already barred a number of British journalists and defence figures as well as hundreds of elected British MPs. In June last year, the BBC's Clive Myrie and Orla Guerin were among journalists who have reported from Ukraine to be banned. BBC director general Tim Davie was also on the list.  The UK is among Western countries to have sanctioned Russia in response to its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.  These include a ban on the import of goods from Russia such as diamonds, oil and gas.  Earlier this month, the British government announced what it described as the ""largest ever UK action"" targeting Russia's access to foreign military supplies.. More than 1,000 Russian businesses and individuals have been sanctioned by the US, EU, UK and other countries.",Kathryn Armstrong,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-66548488
